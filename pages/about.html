            I am an Electronics Technician with a diverse technical background
            and experience in computers, electronics, including diagnostics,
            service, and repair. My background focuses on the engineering of
            electrical systems, as I have worked on projects that cover
            mechanics, robotics, electronics, and programming. I am adept in
            using advanced ECAD and MCAD designing tools and I am passionate
            about designing printed circuit board 'PCB'. I can operate a variety
            of equipment like 3D printers, CNC machines, and laser cutters.

            The content on this site is the outcome of the journey of teaching
            myself how to become a web developer. The site itself is served from
            Github Pages. There's a lot to come, as I keep improving my coding
            skills.
